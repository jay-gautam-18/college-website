            The department of MCA was started in 1998 with an objective to provide a conducive ambiance for learning Computer Applications & career-oriented subjects. The department has fine-tuned up and has many MOUs with the industries to inculcate knowledge in the students in the field of information technology and current trends.
Purpose of the Student Induction Program is to help new students adjust and feel comfortable in the new environment, inculcate in them the ethos and culture of the institution, help them build bonds with other students and faculty members, and expose them to a sense of larger purpose and self-exploration. The term induction is generally used to describe the whole process whereby the incumbents adjust to or acclimatize to their new roles and environment. In other words, it is a well-planned event to educate the new entrants about the environment in a particular institution, and connect them with the people in it. Student Induction Program engages with the new student.
