          "It is not good grades, but a "grounding in soft skills" that give people who went to independent schools their edge, a former public school has argued."

        <p className="mb-4">
          Soft Skills refers to the personal attributes which enables the person to interact well in professional world. In recent years the soft skills has become more and more important as companies expect their employees to know how to behave on the job, to understand how important it is to be on time, to work as a team, to take initiatives and bring out excellent quality work.

        <p>
          Soft skills are challenging to develop, as they are closely associated with a person's character. It takes conscious effort, ongoing practice, and a commitment to self-development. For engineering sector, as in any other type of jobs, besides technical skills, the management is keenly looking forward to soft skills in its potential employees.

        <p>
          In this era of the toughest competition where only survival of the fittest exists, LNCT has come up with a new initiative of being the first college in MP to introduce French as a third language in order to make itâ€™s students upbeat and distinguished from the crowd. French is the second language only after English that is spoken in all five continents. Knowledge of French opens the door of French companies in France and other French speaking parts of the world. The training is highly practical and provides the average package of an engineer who has never worked with French is nearly 7 times that of a normal engineer. By the same token, speaking French opens up study opportunities at renowned French universities and business schools and makes the top higher education institutes more accessible. Students with good proficiency in French have a better chance of being hired.
