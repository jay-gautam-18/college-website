        <p>
          The Department of Civil Engineering is established in 2004,
          initially with an intake of 30 at undergraduate level and 18 at
          postgraduate level in 2007. Department has developed over the years
          with an increase in intake from 60 to 120 at undergraduate
          program, 24 at postgraduate program at present.
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          The department strongly believes in making continuous efforts to
          strive for excellence by exploring new frontiers of knowledge in
          engineering and technology. It guides its students the best
          available instructions of the curriculum. It also conducts
          regularly national conferences, seminars and special guest
          lectures for the benefit of faculty, staff and students. It also
          collaborates actively for academia – industry interactions. The
          department also communicates suggestions to affiliating
          university for academic developments. The department also
          conducts Staff Development Program and national conference with
          the support of AICTE for faculty members. In the field of
          academic consultancy the department is recognized center in
          Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal of Institution of Civil Engineers, Karol
          Bagh, New Delhi.
        </p>

        <p>
