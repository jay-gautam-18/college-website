        The department of Mathematics, one of the vibrant department of the institution, established in the year 1994. Department functions as a service agency providing support to UG & PG departments and lays a sound foundation for learning engineering & technical subjects. The aim of department is to inculcate analytical skills in mathematical sciences so as to enable the students to apply and formulate in solution making approaches of their technical subjects. Definitely the learning of mathematics will enhance and widen the mathematical aptitude, analytical skills, logical reasoning and systematic thinking of the students.
