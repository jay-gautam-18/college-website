          e believe, our first responsibility is to the students & their parents in meeting their needs; everything we do must be of high quality.
          We must constantly strive to improve our standards. New equipments must be purchased and new facilities provided.
          Research must be carried on, innovative ideas developed and industries collaborated with.
        </p>

        <p>
          We must be knowledge creators rather than merely knowledge consumers. We must constantly train our teachers & staff,
          men and women who work with us. We must recognize their merit and respect their dignity.
          They must have a sense of loyalty and their compensation must be fair & adequate.
          There must be a clean, orderly and enjoyable environment. We must inculcate in our students principle-bound self-discipline,
          and ability to “take charge”. They must learn to realize and perform and build personality,
          so as to be an asset to any organization they are associated with. They must be ready to face the challenges of competitive world.
        </p>

        <p>
          They must be ready to face the challenges of competitive world and be a successful entrepreneur.
          Our final responsibility is to the community, in which we live, work, and the environment and resources we are endowed by Mother Nature to enjoy.

            This is invaluable quotation <span className="font-sanskrit">श्रद्धावान् लभते ज्ञानम्</span> has been extracted from shloka 39 of chapter four
            from Shrimad Bhagvata. It means: a person who has “Shardha” – trust, faith and belief shall attain KNOWLEDGE.
            In other words, one who has unwavering faith and the teaching of guru’s, teachers and textbooks only shall obtain knowledge.

            The symbols/figures appearing in the mono signify that water harnessed by dams is used for irrigation and power generation.
            The electrical power so generated is transmitted and distributed for domestic and industrial purposes to run industries.
            In addition, the non-conventional sources of energy also need to be tapped to complement the conventional energy.
            The sign curve signifies the applications of mathematical concepts to all branches of engineering and technology.
