        <p>
          Many students opted for book bank scheme which costs Rs. 4000 for the entire course. This scheme runs on the premise
          that each student should possess at least one text book for each subject throughout his/her 4 years of study. Procuring
          these books from the market is arduous and expensive proposition and also some editions are not available in the
          market. Book bank scheme is devised to overcome this problem. Large number of students are availing this facility.

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Working of the Book Bank Scheme</h3>
        <p>
          Principal, HODs and faculty members decide the best books that cover the entire syllabus of the subject. These books
          are purchased and accessioned in the Library and issued to each student (one set) for a period of one year / semester.
          At the end of the year/semester the student has to return all the books and then books of the next semester are issued
          on the last day of the semester.
