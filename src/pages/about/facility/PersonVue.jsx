        certification programmes such as Cisco, CompTIA, EMC, HP, LPI, Oracle and VMware. <strong>LNCTE</strong> will also
        have the ability to deliver the <strong>Graduate Management Admission Test® (GMAT®)</strong> – the most widely used

        certification, licensure and academic admissions markets.
