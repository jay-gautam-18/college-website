Unlike traditional cryptography, steganography conceals the existence of information. His research enhances embedding capacity and security by integrating compression methods and pixel manipulation. He also developed a pre-processor and classifier to guide users in selecting the best combination of compression and embedding based on image features, significantly boosting the adaptability and effectiveness of secure image-based communication.

            <strong>Thesis Topic:</strong> “Improvement of Power System Stability Using Artificial Intelligence Based Power System Stabilizers”</p>
        <p><strong>Specialization:</strong> Power System</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Research Summary:</strong> Dr. Shrivastava's research focuses on enhancing power system stability using Artificial Intelligence-based stabilizers. The work compares conventional Delta-Omega and multiband PSS for interconnected systems and employs Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Interactive Artificial Bee Colony (IABC) algorithms for tuning their parameters. These AI-based techniques are computationally efficient and highly effective in improving stability for both single-machine and multimachine systems under small and large disturbances. The algorithms were tested across various operating conditions and demonstrated significant performance improvement.
